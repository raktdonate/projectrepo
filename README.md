About project

In the past itâ€™s been recorded that every day, 12000 people die in India due to non-availability of blood and the huge gap between demand & supply.
This fact gave us the inspiration and a vision to work on and now here we present redToLiFE to you.
There is Home Page. Here redToLiFE checks the eligibility of a person for blood donation according to the inputs provided and here some tips regarding blood donation are being shown. We have also provided a review section for the users of redToLiFE to give their honest reviews about our platform.
There is Donate section of our website, where a donor can easily locate a blood bank in his or her area using pincode or state. This data is being taken from the India government databases which was updated till last month hence providing the latest and correct information.
There is Donor community. A special community created for the donors where they can join only after creating an account on redToLiFE. Here they can provide their contact info through which a needy person can contact and get the blood from the donors.
The NGO Community section. Here the NGOs can join after creating their respective accounts. The NGOs can get access to the donor community to look for the correct donors for their need and can also provide donors or help to the person in need.
