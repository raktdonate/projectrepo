            <p class="para">What if everyone eligible to donate became complacent and decided they didn't need to donate because
                someone else would?
                </p>

               <p class="para"> What if there wasn't enough donated blood available when you, a loved one - anyone - needed it? Blood cannot be manufactured it can only come from generous donors.</p>
            
            <p class="para"> A study in 2022 extrapolated the eligible donor population in India at 402 million. The supply was
                estimated at 33.8 donations against the demand of 36.3 per thousand donations, translating to a shortage
                of one million units annually. Medical specialty had the highest demand for blood at 6.0 million units
                (41.2%), followed by surgery 4.1 million (27.9%), obstetrics and gynecology 3.3 million (22.4%) and
                pediatrics 1.2 million (8.5%)</p>
           <p class="para"> The need for blood is universal, but access to safe blood for everyone who needs it remains a challenge
            worldwide. Voluntary, unpaid blood donors who give blood regularly can help overcome blood shortages. Their
            altruistic donation saves lives, they are heroes. We can all be heroes </p>
